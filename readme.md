* Search markdown preview on on the command pallete you scene.
* Choose preview(Open preview or Open Locked preview to the side) according to your necessity.

## step2

* I noticed that you are using python 3.7.2/ 3.7.5 now since you installed python Pycharm. Python 3.9 is the latest version of python. It is a bleeding edge version of python. But we have to choose better and stable version of python so that tensorflow ccan work without any problem. If you have any doubt go to [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/). See what is written in left sidebar.
* Tensorflow also recommends python 3.6 or 3.7 as per their docs.
* So go to your **control panel** $\rarr$ **Programs** $\rarr$ **Uninstall a program**. Then search for **Pycharm** $\rarr$ right click $\rarr$ uninstall. Same thing you have to do with python as well python launcher.
* Now we have to install python 3.6.5. So go to [official python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/). Go to bottom of the page. Then download **Windows x86-64 executable installer**.
* Install python 3.6.5. Don't forgot to add python 3.6 to path while clicking few next buttons.

* if you installed everything successfully check whether everything correctly.  In order to do so press <span style="background:#fff;color:#000;padding:3px; border-radius:3px; margin-bottom:5px;">Win Key + R</span>. It will open up a small window on your bottom left corner of display. Type <span style="background:#fff;color:#000;padding:3px; border-radius:3px; margin-bottom:5px;">cmd</span> down there and hit enter. It will open up command prompt. In command prompt type **python** and hit enter. It will open up python interpreter which shows current version of Python. If it is not seems to be working you didn't added python 3.6 to path.
* I will edit docs.md soon. Have a nice day.
